# API-Development

# Setting up the Code Environment:

Install Node.js: Download and install the latest version of Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org).
Create a new directory for your project.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Initializing the Node.js Project:

# Run the following command in the terminal to initialize a new Node.js project:
csharp

  npm init -y
  
# Install the required packages (express and csv-parser) using the following command:

  npm install express csv-parser

# This will create a package.json file in your project directory.
  Installing Required Packages:

    Express: Express is a popular web framework for Node.js. Install it by running the following command:

  npm install express


# csv-parser: Install the csv-parser package to parse the CSV file. Run the following command:

  npm install csv-parser
  
# Creating the Express Application:

Create a new JavaScript file, e.g., app.js, in your project directory.

# Import the necessary modules:
javascript

const express = require('express');
const csvParser = require('csv-parser');
const fs = require('fs');

# Running the Express Application:

Add the following lines at the end of app.js to run the Express application:
javascript

  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
      });
# Save and close the file.

In the terminal, navigate to your project directory.

# Run the Express application using the following command:

  node app.js


# Testing the APIs:

Use tools like Postman or cURL to send requests to the API endpoints and validate their responses.
Create a collection in Postman and include requests for all the API use cases mentioned in the assignment.
Remember to include a README file in your project that provides instructions on how to set up the code environment and run the application. You can include any additional setup or configuration steps specific to your project.
